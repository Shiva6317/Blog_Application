Subject: Request for Temporary Mess Facility Access without Fee Submission

Respected Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to request permission to avail of the mess facility at [Hostel Name] without submitting the requisite fee immediately. I understand that timely payment of fees is essential to support the hostel's operations, and I assure you that I will submit the full fee within the next 5 days.

My name is Shivjeet, and my roll number is [Your Roll Number]. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I am currently facing a temporary financial constraint that has caused a delay in my fee payment. However, I am committed to fulfilling my financial obligations to the hostel, and I kindly request your understanding and cooperation during this brief period of adjustment.

I kindly request your permission to continue using the mess facility while I arrange the necessary funds. I want to assure you that this delay is purely circumstantial, and I am dedicated to maintaining my financial responsibilities in the hostel.

If granted permission, I will submit the full fee by [Specify a Date Within 5 Days], which will enable me to regularize my account promptly. I understand that any delay beyond the specified date will result in the discontinuation of mess facility access until the outstanding fee is paid.

I am grateful for your consideration and understanding in this matter. Your support will greatly assist me during this challenging time.

Thank you for your time and attention to my request. I look forward to a positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
